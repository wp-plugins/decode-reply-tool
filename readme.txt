== Frequently asked questions ==

= Do I have to have Decode to use this plugin? =
Absolutely not! The Decode Reply Tool is designed with Decode in mind, but the concept could work with most other blog-style themes. Results may vary, of course because I can't test it against all other themes. 

= Do I have to know how to code or edit my theme files? =
Not at all! Decode is as simple as can be; you never need to look at a bit of code. Furthermore, the [Decode theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/decode), was designed specifically with this plugin in mind, so if you use that theme, you are certainly spared from messing around in code and theme files.
